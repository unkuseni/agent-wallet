### DeFi Developer Challenge – Agentic Wallets for AI Agents

### Task Overview

As AI agents on Solana evolve into autonomous participants within the ecosystem, they require wallets that enable them to act independently. These wallets, known as agentic wallets, are specifically designed for AI agents to securely sign transactions, hold funds, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) without human intervention.

This challenge invites developers to create a prototype of an agentic wallet that showcases autonomous transaction capabilities in a secure and controlled environment.

### Submission Requirements

Your project must include:

- A functional agentic wallet that can:
  - Programmatically create a wallet
  - Automatically sign transactions
  - Hold SOL or SPL tokens
  - Interact with a test dApp or protocol
- A comprehensive explanation of the wallet's design, security measures, and its interaction with AI agents (in video or written format)
- Open-source code with a clear README and setup instructions
- The option to work solo or in a team of up to 4 developers
- A `SKILLS.md` file for agents to reference
- A working prototype deployed on the Solana devnet

### Potential Project Ideas

Here are some directions you can explore:

- An autonomous wallet that executes pre-scripted trades on a test DeFi protocol
- A wallet integrated with a local AI agent simulation, such as a trading bot or liquidity provider
- A test environment demonstrating multiple agents managing their own wallets
- An optional front-end or CLI to monitor agent wallet activities

### Technical Requirements

- Secure key management and storage tailored for autonomous agents
- Automated transaction signing without requiring manual input
- The ability to simulate decision-making or execution by an AI agent
- A clear separation of responsibilities between agent logic and wallet operations

### Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be judged based on:

- Functional demonstration of an autonomous agent wallet
- Implementation of robust security measures and effective key management
- Quality of documentation and the depth of the accompanying explanation
- Scalability to support multiple agents operating independently
